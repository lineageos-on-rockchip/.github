# LineageOS on Rockchip Devices

This project aims to get LineageOS running on low-end Android devices powered by Rockchip systems-on-chip. For now we are aiming to get LineageOS 18.1 to run on the second-generation LeapPadÂ® Academy (UYT4) by VTech under the LeapFrog brand running off an RK3326, though we may plan to develop ports for other similar devices soon.
